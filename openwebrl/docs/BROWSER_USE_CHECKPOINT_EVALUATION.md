# Browser Use evaluations of checkpoints after iterations 20 and 30

The user requested this follow-up on 2026-09-10 after the intermediate checkpoint
evaluations. The initial selection was **after training iteration 30**:
`/gpfs/scrubbed/zixianma/openwebrl-runtime/runs/openwebrl-4b-reference-286382-20260910T164338/iter_0000029`.
It scored **96/300 task successes (32%)**, with 52 invalid attempts, on the existing
GPT-4.1 monitor. After-20 scored 95/300, after-21 89/300, and after-22 86/300.
This is the best observed score among evaluated checkpoints; its one-task lead
over after-20 does not establish a statistically reliable ranking.

The user subsequently requested **both after-20 and after-30** on a new
allocation. After-20 has the best valid-only rate (95/232 = 40.95%); after-30 has
the best all-task rate (96/300 = 32%). The additional checkpoint is
`/gpfs/scrubbed/zixianma/openwebrl-runtime/runs/openwebrl-4b-reference-285546-20260909T235114/iter_0000019`.
The two checkpoints will use the identical 300-task cohort, cloud backend,
proxy policy, judge, and decoding settings. This replaces the earlier single
checkpoint job proposal.

## Prepared execution and budget

The recommended lower-cost template is `scripts/evaluate_browser_use_2gpu.sbatch`:
two sequential 300-task monitors using **2 H200 GPUs, 16 CPUs, 480 GiB RAM, for
3 hours**: **6 GPU-hours**, estimated cluster charge **$5.40**. The earlier
four-GPU template remains available but has not been submitted. Four GPUs were
chosen initially to reuse the verified TP4 loader and four inference workers;
they are not a minimum model-inference requirement. The wrapper now supports TP2
as well as TP4. Fifteen CPU tests and both TP2 launch dry runs pass; actual TP4-to-TP2
checkpoint restoration and paired evaluation duration still require live checks.
Host RAM and CPUs remain conservative because the task/data workload is unchanged. It requires explicit approval before submission. The
previous paired-evaluation job 287370 completed in 1:48:47 and released its GPUs.
Training job 287371 remains independent on g005.

Browser Use hosting and GPT-4.1 judge usage are additional. The provider currently
lists **$0.02 per browser-hour**, minute-rounded with unused time refunded. For
one attempt per checkpoint with 600 sessions total, each capped at 12 minutes,
hosting is at most approximately **$2.40 before refunds**. Actual judge cost depends on tokens.
Residential proxies are explicitly disabled (`proxy_country_code=None`). See
[Browser Use browser API](https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/api-v2/browsers/create-browser-session).
The cloud browser itself has [stealth enabled by default](https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/browser/stealth).

The launcher owns its GPU worker and waits after a failure for supervised repair
within the same allocation deadline. It does not submit another allocation or
retry blindly. A new attempt uses a new output directory and W&B identity.

## Protocol and source isolation

The frozen source is runtime `reference-browseruse-eval-20260910`, prepared by
`scripts/prepare_browser_use_evaluation.py` from
`reference-stage1-tp4-eval-cache-20260909`. Only the browser-mode launcher assignment,
Browser Use session lifecycle code, and browser session timeout differ. File
hashes and the parent source are recorded in `reference_manifest.json`. Baseline
training continues using its original source.

The task cohort, model checkpoint, prompts, GPT-4.1 judge, 30-step limit,
deterministic decoding, token limits, and 16 concurrent task limit are preserved.
The evaluation requests zero optimizer updates and validates full checkpoint
restoration and all 300 outcomes. W&B uses
`qcq7i4ug-eval-browseruse-after20-JOB` and `qcq7i4ug-eval-browseruse-after30-JOB`, separate from the training history and the
local-browser evaluation. The manifest identifies the changed browser backend.

The SDK is pinned to **3.11.3** in an isolated runtime import overlay. Its existing
runtime dependencies are retained: httpx 0.28.1, pydantic 2.13.5, idna 3.19. These
last two are newer patch versions than the SDK's exact metadata pins; import,
create/get/stop, CDP, and full adapter tests passed. The shared training
installation was not modified. An unused 2.0.15 overlay was inspected but is not
used because its browser-method names differ.

The requested browser screen is 1280×1000. The live cloud browser reported a
1280×788 CSS viewport at DPR 2 (2560×1576 physical pixels). The existing adapter
realigns coordinate transforms to the actual viewport. This rendering difference
must accompany any score comparison; the experiment changes the browser service
and its rendering environment, not solely a stealth flag.

## Validation and lifecycle

Preflight evidence is runtime `evaluations/browser-use-preflight-20260910/`:

- `smoke_report.json`: authenticated CDP connection, Example Domain HTTP 200,
  screenshot capture, and independently confirmed remote stop.
- `adapter_smoke_report.json`: the actual OpenWebRL Browser Use adapter passed
  setup, screenshot capture, viewport alignment, and confirmed-stop receipt.
- `concurrency_report.json`: 16 simultaneously created cloud sessions, all 16
  subsequently confirmed stopped, without API errors.
- `evaluation_plan_after20.json`, `evaluation_plan.json`, and launcher dry runs:
  exact checkpoint indices 19 and 29,
  zero training rollouts, and selected cloud-browser environment.

Fifteen CPU tests cover checkpoint and browser identity, missing/incomplete
results, unexpected optimization, delayed remote shutdown, receipt preservation
on a stop failure, and concurrent initialization cleanup. Shell syntax passed.
Full GPU evaluation remains pending an explicitly approved allocation.

Each evaluation tracks its own remote session IDs under its output's
`browser_sessions/`; confirmed stopped IDs are retained under `stopped/`.
Cleanup runs once per process and cannot sweep another newly created session.
Stop failures retain the active receipt for supervised recovery. Live/CDP URLs
are excluded from shared logs. Creation POSTs disable automatic retries to avoid
creating an untracked duplicate browser after an ambiguous network failure.
The browser timeout is 12 minutes, exceeding the 600-second task deadline.

At evaluation completion or failure, inspect active receipts and confirm those
specific sessions stopped via the SDK before declaring cleanup complete. Never
stop account-wide or unrelated Browser Use sessions. A batch timeout does not
itself prove that the remote browsers have stopped.
