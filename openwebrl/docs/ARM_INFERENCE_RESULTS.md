# ARM inference results on Online-Mind2Web

Snapshot: **2026-09-08T08:17:46.840921+00:00**. All three original 300-task evaluations are complete. This is an inference comparison from the frozen `OpenWebRL/OpenWebRL-4B-SFT` actor, not an ARM-trained policy result.

## Completed results

| Arm | Scheduled | Completed | Successes | Valid | Unavailable | Overall success | Valid-only success |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Baseline, one candidate | 300 | 300 | 90 | 267 | 33 | **30.0% (90/300)** | **33.7% (90/267)** |
| ScalarRM-LoRA, best of five | 300 | 300 | 114 | 251 | 49 | **38.0% (114/300)** | **45.4% (114/251)** |
| SelectionARM, best of five | 300 | 300 | 128 | 256 | 44 | **42.7% (128/300)** | **50.0% (128/256)** |

Overall success = successes / all 300 scheduled tasks; unavailable outcomes contribute no success. Valid-only success = successes / valid judged outcomes. Report both; excluding failures changes the task population, and missingness can depend on the arm.

ScalarRM improves overall success by **8.0 percentage points**, or **24 additional successful tasks**. The difference between the separate valid-only rates is **11.7 points**, but those denominators contain different tasks.

## Paired comparison on tasks valid in both arms

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Common valid tasks | 244 |
| Baseline successes | 88/244 = **36.1%** |
| ScalarRM successes | 113/244 = **46.3%** |
| Paired gain | **10.25 percentage points** |
| Paired task-bootstrap 95% interval | **[4.10, 16.39] points** |
| Scalar-only successes / baseline-only successes | 43 / 18 |
| Exact two-sided McNemar p-value | 0.00187 |

This supports an inference gain in this run. The interval conditions on the 244 commonly evaluable tasks and does not measure seed, judge, website, or date variability. It does not establish standalone-policy learning or exact reproduction of historical README rates.

## Completed SelectionARM result and C2 teacher

SelectionARM completed **300/300**, with **128 successes**, **256 valid**, and **44 unavailable** outcomes. Its success rates are **42.7% overall** and **50.0% valid-only**. Relative to baseline, this is **+12.7 percentage points overall**; relative to ScalarRM, it is **+4.7 points overall**.

On the **236 tasks valid for both ScalarRM and SelectionARM**, SelectionARM has 12 additional successes, a paired gain of **5.08 percentage points** (paired bootstrap 95% interval **−1.27 to +11.86 points**; exact McNemar p = **0.169**). Full paired statistics, including discordant counts, are recorded in `full/selection-vs-scalar-paired.json`. The difference is a single-run estimate, not proof of superiority across seeds or website states.

The C2 teacher rule selected **SelectionARM** because it has both more successes on all 300 tasks and a positive common-valid difference. [C2 run configuration and status](ARM_C2_RUN.md). The student has not yet been evaluated.

## Unavailable outcomes and retry decision

| Recorded failure category | Baseline | ScalarRM |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| No turn-level samples / turn-index wrapper error | 22 | 26 |
| Actor HTTP 400 | 5 | 12 |
| Environment step error | 5 | 6 |
| Actor request timeout (180 seconds) | 1 | 3 |
| Whole-task timeout (1800 seconds) | 0 | 2 |
| Total unavailable | **33** | **49** |

The no-turn wrapper hides the originating exception; earlier log inspection identified navigation failures in most audited baseline cases. It is not an independent diagnosis. Observed actor HTTP 400 logs include requests exceeding the 32768-token context budget. Timeouts and context overflow may reflect trajectory length or candidate-generation cost, so unavailable outcomes are not automatically unrelated to model behavior.

**Current decision: retries remain held. SelectionARM is now complete; the user requested C2 next, and the retry cohort/arms still need a separate decision.** The following two-arm counts describe the earlier proposal, not an active queue:

- The unavailable-task union contains **56 tasks**: **26 unavailable in both**, **7 baseline-only**, and **23 scalar-only**.
- Run both arms once on each of those 56 tasks: **112 additional task attempts**. This includes repeating the previously valid counterpart, so the follow-up compares the same tasks in the same time window. A smaller alternative is retrying only each arm's own unavailable cases (82 attempts), but that is a recovery sensitivity analysis with asymmetric extra opportunities.
- First classify the originating failures. Retry transient website/network/browser failures with unchanged model, sampling, horizon, and timeout settings. Record persistent failures explicitly.
- A larger context budget or a new truncation policy is a protocol change, not an ordinary retry. Define it for both arms and report a separate experiment; an unchanged retry will not reliably cure a context-limit failure.
- Freeze the task cohort and one-attempt budget before inspecting follow-up outcomes. Use fresh browsers; balance or interleave arm order where serving permits. No repeated attempts until success, no selecting the best result across attempts, and no overwriting original result files.
- Keep the original table above as the primary report. Report retry-cohort coverage and paired outcomes separately. If assembling a 300-task sensitivity table, replace **both** arms' entries for the entire selected cohort using the predeclared retry attempt and label the table as a mixed-session sensitivity analysis.
- For a three-arm robustness comparison, use the completed unavailable sets to freeze a common cohort across **all three** arms and give every arm the same follow-up cohort and budget. C2 currently has execution priority.

A proposed two-arm task/index inventory is prepared at [retry-baseline-scalar-union.json](/gpfs/scrubbed/zixianma/openwebrl-runtime/arm-reproduction/runs/dedicated-282209-20260908T005547Z/retry-baseline-scalar-union.json). **The user clarified on 2026-09-08 that we should redecide retry queries after SelectionARM. The automatic launch is disabled, and no retry has started.** [Separate retry status/results](ARM_INFERENCE_RETRY_RESULTS.md). Reconcile all three unavailable sets and originating failures before deciding the final cohort, arms, and budget; keep the 56-task two-arm inventory as a provisional option.

## Protocol, provenance, and artifacts

- Actor: `OpenWebRL/OpenWebRL-4B-SFT`, revision `15e777db2ddba2e0e82080ebccd3ad8d215b7f0a`.
- Scalar: `PTeterwak/OpenWebRL-4B-ScalarRM-LoRA`, revision `71c58489cd7cbaebcd74656df7ef11ba818661b8`.
- Selection: `PTeterwak/OpenWebRL-4B-SelectionARM`, revision `81b452d800d9f859687074f82680dd5257e02d89`.
- ARM source revision: `02276b0ff3b9048d34e6a2afdcb9042dd9018c8c`.
- Same 300 task IDs; temperature 0.7, top-p 0.9, seed 42 with deterministic task/turn/candidate derivation; 1024 generated tokens, 30 browser steps, one current screenshot with full action history; actor context limit 32768.
- Online-Mind2Web/AgentTrek outcome protocol with o4-mini. Candidate counts: one baseline, five per ARM. Constrained canonical no-CoT JSON schema for SelectionARM; scalar uses the released OpenWebRL serialization and BF16 last-token head.
- Baseline used task concurrency 8; both ARMs used 16. The actor and one ARM shared one H200. This comparison does not isolate concurrency effects or match inference compute.
- Baseline and the first 277 saved scalar outcomes came from allocation 282209 on g001. The remaining 23 scalar tasks resumed in allocation 282782 on g005; earlier interrupted partial action traces were archived. All 577 previously saved result files were hash-verified unchanged after resumption. SelectionARM runs on g005. Live-site time differences remain a confound.
- Historical README targets are 33.8%, 46.3%, and 51.1%; exact historical denominators/settings are not fully recovered. Our paired ScalarRM rate rounding to 46.3% is not evidence that the historical protocol matches. The [judge alignment audit](ARM_JUDGE_ALIGNMENT.md) confirms the README uses o4-mini and the dashboard describes AgentTrek, seed 42, and a final high-detail screenshot. It also documents the author's separate GPT-4.1 re-judging and decoding differences; our run is not an exact end-to-end reconstruction.
